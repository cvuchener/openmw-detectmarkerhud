Installation
------------

Copy/extract this directory and add it to OpenMW data.

Enable `DetectMarkerHUD.omwscripts`.


Usage
-----

Cast any "Detect" spell and the corresponding markers should appear. In area
with a lot of objects (items, containers, actors), it may require a few frame
to test everything.

Some settings may be configured in the "Options" â†’ "Scripts" menu. Some will
change how markers are displayed. The performance settings allows you to change
how many objects are checked each frame: higher values means it will take less
frames to test everything in big cells, but the script will be more likely to
impact the game framerate.
